# runes
making an alphabet to write a made-up language in, complete with turtle graphics code for transliteration.

The characters are somewhat inspired by futhark runes, but with my own spin on it. 

The rest of this document is lore/backstory brainstorming, so if you don't care, you can stop reading.

This is a written language derived from dragons' use of symbols for communication.
Most symbols utilize only straight lines, for better ease of carving into rock.

Dragons (in my personal mythology) communicate by scratching these symbols into stones. 
(or by spoken language, but I haven't got to that yet. This is just the alphabet)

My dragons are not the same as dragons from any particular mythology or system, but rather have elements from pretty much any system I liked, as well as some from my own design.

Dragons are powerful creatures. They can be good, evil, or some combination thereof, but most all of them grow reclusive with age.
depending on the alloy of their scales, some combinations of traits are substantially more common than others.

Dragons are social at a very young age (up to around 80-120, depending on their type) as they still live with their parents and siblings.
Dragon scales are usually composed of an alloy of two or more metals, although rare pure-metal dragons are possible, albeit rare.
The metals in these alloys tend to have a substantial effect on their personality, as they affect their metabolism and brain function.

Most dragons' scales contain mithril, which gives them both their substantial physical strength and some of their magic.
Dragons love to collect large quantities of gold, gems, and other valueable shiny things. 
Their metabolisms are quite sophisticated, operating mostly by magic, such that consuming any metal allows them to convert the atoms internally into the nutrients they need.
A common misconception is that dragons eat people or other creatures. This is not the case. 
People who are reported missing after an encounter with a dragon are typically part of some experiment, as dragons are quite curious about the world, and have no moral qualms about capturing lesser creatures to experiment upon.

While dragons are normally not hostile (unless they are looking for a test subject), they do defend themselves and their hoards with lethal strength, should the situation call for it.
